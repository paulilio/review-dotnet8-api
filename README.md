# .NET 8 Web API - Practical Review & Best Practices

This lab project is based on a .NET course I'm currently taking (Module 4). 
It is used for practice and to help colleagues understand key backend concepts.
It is part of my personal review and consolidation of core concepts in modern .NET 8 Web API development.

The goal is to apply and revisit important patterns and tools using simple but realistic examples.
Each module represents a focused topic (e.g., DI, DTOs, FluentValidation, EF Core, etc).

## Topics Covered (so far)

- Clean project structure and minimal setup
- Controllers and REST principles
- DTOs and Entity mapping
- FluentValidation for input validation
- EF Core and database migrations
- Unit tests and integration tests (coming soon)
- Middleware and exception handling (coming soon)
